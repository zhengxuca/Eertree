# Eertree
Eertree (Also known as Palindromic Tree)

EerTree is a very new data structure invented in 2014 and first published in a 2015 paper.
It was difficult for me to understand at first. I used the two links in the references to learn Eeetree.
This Git repo contains an implemention of EerTree to solve the problem of Longest Palindromic Substring.
My implemention passed Leetcode's Online Judge.
